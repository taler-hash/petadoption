                At the Pawprints, hundreds of rescues are waiting to find their
                fur-ever homes. Many of our Adoptables have been rescued from death row, from local pounds or from
                abusive environments. They are all vaccinated, dewormed and neutered and can be visited anytime, just
                with prior registration.

                By choosing to adopt, you are giving an animal the chance to find a new home and to feel the love and
                security they deserve. You are also helping free up more space in our shelters, allowing us to rescue
                and rehabilate more animals.
